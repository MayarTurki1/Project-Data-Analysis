Introduction:

This project focuses on market basket analysis using frequent itemset mining techniques. The primary goal is to discover associations between products purchased together, utilizing the FP-Growth algorithm.


Data Exploration:

The dataset is loaded and cleaned before performing exploratory analysis. Basic statistics and summaries of the data are presented to understand its structure.

Market Basket Analysis:

The FP-Growth algorithm is applied to extract frequent itemsets from the market basket dataset.


Data preprocessing includes organizing the transactions in a suitable format for the FP-Growth algorithm.


Visualization:

Results of frequent itemsets and association rules are visualized to showcase the most common patterns and product associations.
